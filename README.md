# Con Sazon
An MVP for a meal planning app that aims to share culturally competent & nutritious recipes from Latinx and BIPOC creators. It's your abuela's little black book of recipes.

### :construction: This webapp is actively under construction! ###

## Some Notes:

I've focused on functionality over design at this point. I've learned alot about working with mongoDb and mongoose during the development of this app. I'm looking forward to continuing to dive deep into it's backend.  

**Tech used:**  HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, MongoDb, EJS

## Optimizations (Coming soon)

1. Re-designing the UI to be fully responsive.
2. Implementing a printable shopping list of the ingredients required for a user's meal plan.
3. Eventually re-designing the UI with React.  
4. Adding more features! Stay tuned...
