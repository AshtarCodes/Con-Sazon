# Con Sazon
An MVP for a meal planning app that aims to share culturally competent & nutritious recipes from Latinx and BIPOC creators. What if your abuela had a little black book of recipes? That's us.   

I love to discover new recipes and cook delicious meals for my family. Growing up, my fondest memories were when my abuela cooked up basically anything for me! It was all delicious and "con sazon" (with spices)! Building this app is personal for me, this is my way of sharing and highlighting the flavors &  from the blend of cultures and cuisines I grew up eating. Buen Provecho! (enjoy your meal ðŸ˜‹)

### :construction: This webapp is actively under construction! ###

## Some Notes:

I've focused on functionality over design at this point. I've learned alot about working with MongoDb and Mongoose during the development of this app. I'm looking forward to continuing to dive deep into it's backend, and revamping the UI.  

**Tech used:**  HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Express, MongoDb, EJS

## Optimizations (Coming soon)

1. Working on the responsiveness and design of the UI.
2. Implementing a printable shopping list of the ingredients required for a user's meal plan.
3. Validating the recipe form. 
4. Eventually re-designing the UI with React.  
5. Adding more features! Stay tuned.
